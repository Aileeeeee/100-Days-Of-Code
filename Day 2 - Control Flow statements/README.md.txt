Day 2: Control Flow Statements
ðŸš€ 100 Days of Code Challenge

On Day 2, I focused on mastering Python's control flow statements, including if, if-else, elif, and nested conditions. These are fundamental tools for writing logical, decision-making code.

This repository contains my:

Solutions to practical exercises.


Concepts Covered
If Statements: Execute code only when a condition is True.
If-Else Statements: Add logic for both True and False cases.
Elif Statements: Handle multiple conditions in sequence.
Nested Conditions: Combine multiple checks for complex scenarios.

Exercises
1. Are You Rich?
A program that checks if the wallet balance is $20 or more (rich!) or less than $20 (broke!).

Skills Practiced: Input validation, comparison operators, formatted outputs.
2. Cats or Dogs?
A fun exercise to determine pet ownership preferences using both:

if statements only.
if-else statements.
Skills Practiced: Logical conditions, nested decision-making.



3. True/False Quiz
A Python program that:
Asks a series of True/False questions.
Compares user responses with correct answers.
Calculates and displays the accuracy rate.
Skills Practiced: Loops, input handling, condition checks, and formatted output.
