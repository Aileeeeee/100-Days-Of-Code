In this repository, I focused on building Python projects and deepening my understanding of functions. These projects revolve around creating reusable, modular code while tackling real-world scenarios.

# Exercises I worked on
- Sum of Numbers
   - A function that takes any number of integers as arguments and returns their sum.
   - Key Concept: *args for flexible argument handling.

- Grades
   - A function to calculate and return a studentâ€™s average grade.
   - Key Concept: Handling variable positional arguments for grades.

- User Profile
   - A function to collect user details (name, gender, state, etc.) and display them neatly.
   - Key Concept: **kwargs for keyword arguments.

- Maximum Value Finder
   - A function to determine the maximum value from a list of numerical inputs.
   -  Concept: Validation and handling numerical data.

# Lessons Learnt
-  *args and **kwargs for handling flexible arguments.
- Input validation and user interaction via Python scripts.
- Writing reusable and modular functions.
