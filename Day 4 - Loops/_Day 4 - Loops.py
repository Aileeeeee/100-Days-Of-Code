Write a script that does the following:

- Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
- the script to print the square of each number from 1 to 10.

Write a script that does the following:

Repeatedly ask the user to guess a secret number (e.g., 7).
Stop the loop when the user guesses the correct number and display a success message.
Bonus: Add a counter to track how many attempts the user needed to guess the correct number.

1. Track Patient Weight
Write a Python script to evaluate whether each patientâ€™s weight meets or exceeds a specified standard weight. The program should:

- Take a list of patient weights (in kg) as input.
- Compare each patient's weight to a standard weight (e.g., 75 kg).
- For each patient, display whether they meet, exceed, or fall short of the standard.

At the end, summarize the total number of patients who are:
- Below the standard weight.
- At or above the standard weight.
