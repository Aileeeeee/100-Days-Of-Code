This repository contains exercises and solutions from Day 6 of my 100 Days of Code journey, focusing on dictionaries and sets in Python. The projects are inspired by real-world applications in health and patient data management.

# Contents
- Store Health Metrics
   - Create a dictionary to store and update patient health metrics, including height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

- Medication Category Frequencies
   - Use a dictionary to count the frequency of medication categories.
   - Identify the most and least frequent categories and display results in descending order.

- Health Items Inventory
   - Manage a store inventory using a dictionary of health items and their quantities.
   - Calculate the total quantity of items.

- BMI Calculator
   - Calculate and store Body Mass Index (BMI) for patients using a dictionary.

- Set Operations on Patient Data
   - Perform operations like union, intersection, difference, and subset checks on patient data with conditions like hypertension and diabetes.
   - Find unique patients and sort results alphabetically.

# Lessons learnt: 
- Storing and manipulating structured data using dictionaries.
- Counting frequencies and sorting data.
- Applying set operations to analyze relationships between datasets.
- Iterating and presenting data in a user-friendly format.
