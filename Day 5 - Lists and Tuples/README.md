In this project, I built a Patient Management System using lists and tuples to store and manipulate healthcare-related data. The system allows managing patient records, including details like names, diagnosis, treatment plans, and medications.

Key Features
Patient Data Storage: Records are stored in lists and tuples for clarity and accessibility.
Add New Patient Records: Easily append new patient data with unique IDs.
Update Treatment Plans: Modify patient treatment details dynamically.
Delete Patient Records: Remove records efficiently using unique IDs.
Search by Diagnosis: Retrieve patients with specific health conditions.
üõ†Ô∏è Lessons Learned
Global Variables: I learned how to use the global keyword to maintain a persistent counter for patient IDs across function calls.
Functions for Reusability: By organizing tasks into functions, the code became more reliable and easier to debug.
Dynamic Data Handling: Using while loops and conditionals improved data collection and validation.
