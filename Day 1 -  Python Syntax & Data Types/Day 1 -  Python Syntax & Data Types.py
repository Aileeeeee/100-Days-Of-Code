Fixing the Code: 
Each of the following code blocks includes at least one error that will prevent it from
running. Fix the errors and test to make sure the code runs as expected. Comments at the top
of each block will tell you what the code should do.

# display the text in quotation marks to an output block
Print("Python is fun!")

# Display the text in quotation marks to an output block
# without moving any of the existing code to a different line
print("Python is fun!") print("Python is also easy.")

# Display the text in quotation marks to an output block
# without moving any of the existing code to a different line
print

# Change each variable name to an appropriate name for Python.
# Do not use the same variable name more than one time.
1-name = "Rebecca" # first name
&_name = "Roberts" # last name

# After changing the variable names, update the code below
# to print out each name.

'''Broken Variables: 
Fix the following code to create three valid variable names. Add print() statements to
display the values associated with each variable and run the code to verify that there are no
errors.
