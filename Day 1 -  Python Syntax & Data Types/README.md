Day 1 of my 100 Days of Code journey focuses on understanding Python's basic syntax and essential data types. This foundational knowledge is critical for writing clean, error-free code and working with variables effectively. The skills practiced today are stepping stones toward solving real-world problems with Python.

## Key Concepts Covered

1.  Python Syntax:

- Writing Python code with proper indentation.

- Using print() to display output.

- Adding comments with # to improve code readability.
  

2. Variables:

- Declaring variables to store data.

- Naming conventions for variables.

- Assigning and reassigning values.
  

3. Data Types:

- Integers: Whole numbers (e.g., 5, -10).

- Floats: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).

- Strings: Text data enclosed in quotes (e.g., 'Hello', "World").

- Booleans: Logical values (True, False).
  

4. Basic Input/Output:

- Collecting user input with input().

- Printing results with print() and formatting output.


## Exercises Completed
1. Printing and Comments
Learned how to:

- Display messages using print().

- Use comments to explain code functionality.
  

2. Variables and Data Types
Practiced:

- Declaring and assigning variables.

- Identifying and converting data types.

- Formatting strings with f-strings for dynamic output.
  

3. User Input
- Created simple programs to:

- Collect input from users.

- Validate inputs to ensure proper data types.

- Display results dynamically.
  

4. Error Fixing and Code Corrections
- Fixed syntax errors in print() statements.

- Corrected invalid variable names, replacing them with valid and meaningful alternatives.

- Combined multiple print() statements into one line using semicolons.

- Ensured user input was clean and well-formatted using strip() and capitalize().
  

## Example Tasks Completed:

- Displaying properly formatted outputs after fixing errors.

- Correcting variable names such as 1-name and &_name to first_name and last_name.

- Prompting the user for their place of birth and current location, then displaying the results dynamically.
Display results dynamically.
- Built  a program that assesess the level of patient's health risk based on patient's BMI and smoking status.
